Hey !! This blog is all about sharing my work with people who has the same interest. I hope readers will benefit from the posts that I have shared. You all  welcome to throw stones and flowers at me let comments help you there.  

## Bit About Me:

I work as an Information Security Analyst / Researcher for multinational organization as of my day job and I'm specialized in Application Security. There is another thing which inspired me which is Internet of Things. I'm a big fan of Raspberry Pi and Arduino. It amazed me with it's potential. When you think of making things with IoT your only limitation is your imagination.
